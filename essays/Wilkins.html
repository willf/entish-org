    <p><b>The Analytical Language of John Wilkins</b></p>

    <p>Jorge Luis Borges, from <i>Otras Inquisiciones</i></p>

    <p><i>Translated by Will Fitzgerald</i></p>

    <p>
      I have checked, and the fourteenth edition of the Encyclopaedia Britannica
      has dropped its article on John Wilkins. This makes sense when you think
      of how trivial the article is&mdash;20 lines of purely biographical facts:
      Wilkins was born in 1614, Wilkins died in 1672, Wilkins was chaplain for
      Charles Louise, Elector Palatine; Wilkins was named rector of one of the
      colleges at Oxford, Wilkins was the first Secretary of the Royal Society
      of London, etc. It is wrong, though, if we consider Wilkins's speculative
      work. He was abundantly curious: he was interested in theology,
      cryptography, music, the fabrication of transparent beehives, the orbit of
      an invisible planet, the possibility of traveling to the moon, the
      possibility of, and the principles underlying, a universal language. To
      this last problem he dedicated his book
      <i>Towards a Real Character and a Philosophical Language</i> (600 pages in
      quarto, 1668). Our National Library does not have a copy of this book; I
      have consulted, to write this note,
      <i>The Life and Times of John Wilkins</i> (1910), by P.A. Wright
      Henderson; the <i>W&ouml;rterbuch der Philosophie</i> (1924), by Fritz
      Mauthner; <i>Delphos</i> (1935) by E. Sylvia Pankhurst; and
      <i>Dangerous Thoughts</i> (1939), by Lancelot Hogben.
    </p>

    <p>
      Everyone, at some time, has had to endure one of those never-ending
      debates with someone, who, with copious interjections and locutions,
      insists that&mdash;say&mdash;the Spanish word "luna" is more (or less)
      expressive than the English word "moon." Apart from the obvious
      observation that the monosyllabic "moon" is perhaps more apt to represent
      such a simple object in contrast to the bisyllabic "luna," rhere is
      nothing one can add to these debates&mdash;discounting invented words and
      their derivations, all of the languages of the world (not excepting Johann
      Martin Schleyer's Volap&uuml;k and Peano's Interlingua) are equally
      inexpressive. There is no edition of the Royal Academy's
      <i>Gram&aacute;tica</i> that does not ponder "the enviable treasure of
      picturesque, felicitous and expressive voice of the rhythmic Spanish
      language," but this is mere swagger without support. Still, this self-same
      Royal Academy every few years produces a dictionary that define how
      Spanish sounds&mdash;In the universal language that Wilkins invented at
      the beginning of the 17th century, every word contains its own definition.
      Descartes, in a letter dated November 1629, had already noted that, by
      means of a decimal numbering system, one could learn in a single day to
      name every quantity up to infinity and write them in a new language made
      up of figures<sup
        ><a name="intext1" href="#footnote1" id="intext1">1</a></sup
      >; he also proposed the creation of an analogous language which would be
      general, organizing and including every human thought. John Wilkins, about
      1664, undertook to complete this enterprise.
    </p>

    <p>
      He divided the universe into forty categories or genera, subdivided into
      differences, each subdivided into its own species. To every genus he
      assigned a monosyllable of two letters; for every difference, a consonant;
      for every species, a vowel. For example: <i>de</i>, that is, an element;
      <i>deb</i>, the first of the elements, fire; <i>deba</i> a part of the
      element of fire, a flame. In the analogical language of Letellier (1850),
      <i>a</i>, that is, animal; <i>ab</i>, mammal; <i>abo</i>, carnivore;
      <i>aboj</i>, feline; <i>aboje</i>, cat; <i>abi</i>, herbivore;
      <i>abiv</i>, equine, etc. In the language of Bonifacio Sotos Ochando
      (1845) <i>imaba</i> means building; <i>imaca</i> palace; <i>imafe</i>,
      hospital; <i>imafo</i>, lazaretto; <i>imela</i>, house; <i>imego</i>, a
      post; <i>imede</i>, a pillar; <i>imego,</i> floor; <i>imela</i>, ceiling;
      <i>imogo</i>, window; <i>bire</i>, a bookbinder; <i>birer</i>, bookbinding
      (I owe this final list to a book printed in Buenos Aires in 1886;
      <i>El Curso de lengua universal</i>, by Dr. Pedro Mata).
    </p>

    <p>
      The words in the Analytic Language of John Wilkins are not awkwardly
      created arbitrary symbols; every one of its letters is significant, just
      as the cabalists treat the letters in Holy Scripture. Mauthner observes
      that children could learn this language without knowing it is artificial;
      later, in school, they would discover that it is also a universal key and
      a secret encyclopaedia.
    </p>

    <p>
      I have defined Wilkins's method without examining a problem that is
      impossible or at least difficult to postpone: the value in the
      quadragesimal table that forms the basis of the language. Let us consider
      the eight category, that of <i>minerals</i>. Wilkins divides these into
      <i>common</i> (silica, gravel, slate), <i>useful</i> (marble, amber,
      coral), <i>precious</i> (pearls, opals), <i>transparent</i> (amethyst,
      sapphire) and <i>insoluble</i> (coal, chalk and arsenic). Almost as
      alarming as the eight category is the ninth. This describes metals that
      could be <i>imperfect</i> (cinnabar, quicksilver),
      <i>artificial</i> (bronze, brass), <i>recremental</i> (lime, rust) and
      <i>natural</i> (gold, tin, copper). <strike>Beauty</strike

      >The whale figures in category sixteen; it is a viviparous, oblong fish.
    </p>

    <p>
      These ambiguities, redundancies and deficiencies recall those that Dr.
      Franz Kuhn attributes to a certain Chinese dictionary entitled
      <i>The Celestial Emporium of Benevolent Knowledge</i>. In its remote pages
      it is written that animals can be divided into (a) those belonging to the
      Emperor, (b) those that are embalmed, (c) those that are tame, (d) pigs,
      (e) sirens, (f) imaginary animals, (g) wild dogs, (h) those included in
      this classification, (i) those that are crazy-acting (j), those that are
      uncountable (k) those painted with the finest brush made of camel hair,
      (l) miscellaneous, (m) those which have just broken a vase, and (n) those
      which, from a distance, look like flies. The Bibliographic Institute of
      Brussels practices this chaos: they have partitioned the universe into
      1000 subdivisions, number 262 corresponds to the Pope; #282, to the
      Catholic Religion; #263, the day of the Lord; #268, to the dominical
      schools; #298, to Mormonism; and #294 to Brahmanism, Buddhism, Shintoism
      and Taoism. It doesn't mind heterogeneous subdivisions, for example, #179:
      "Cruelty to animals. Prevention of cruelty to animals. Duels and suicide
      from the moral point of view. Vices and various defects. Virtues and
      various qualities."
    </p>

    <p>
      I have catalogued the arbitrarities of Wilkins, of the unknown (or
      apocryphal) Chinese encyclopaedia writer and of the Bibliographic
      Institute of Brussels; it is clear that there is no classification of the
      Universe that is not arbitrary and full of conjectures. The reason for
      this is very simple: we do not know what kind of thing the universe is.
      "The world," writes David Hume, "is perhaps the rudimentary sketch of a
      childish god, who left it half done, ashamed by his deficient work; it is
      created by a subordinate god, at whom the superior gods laugh; it is the
      confused production of a decrepit and retiring divinity, who has already
      died (<i>Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion</i>, 1779)." But we can go
      further than that, to go on to suspect that there is no universe in a
      unified, organic sense, denoted by this ambitious word. If this is the
      case, it fails to support its intention; it fails to supply the words, the
      definitions, the etymologies, the synonyms out of the secret dictionary of
      God.
    </p>

    <p>
      The impossibility of penetrating the divine scheme of the universe does
      not, however, dissuade us from planning human schemes, even though we know
      they must be provisional. The Analytic Language of Wilkins is not the
      least admirable of these schemes. The genera and species that compose it
      are contradictory and vague; the artifice that the letters of the language
      indicate subdivisions and divisions is, without a doubt, ingenious. The
      word <i>salmon</i> tells us nothing, <i>zana</i>, its corresponding word,
      defines (for one well-versed in the forty categories and the genera of
      these categories) a scaled, fluvial fish of rose-colored flesh.
      (Theoretically, it is not inconceivable to have a language in which the
      name of each being indicates all of the details of its destiny, both past
      and future).
    </p>

    <p>
      Dreams and utopias apart, the most lucidly anyone has written about
      language are in these words by Chesterton: "He knows that there are in the
      soul tints more bewildering, more numberless, and more nameless than the
      colours of an autumn forest... Yet he seriously believes that these things
      can every one of them, in all their tones and semitones, in all their
      blends and unions, be accurately represented by an arbitrary system of
      grunts and squeals. He believes that an ordinary civilized stockbroker can
      really produce out of his own inside noises that denote all the mysteries
      of memory and all the agonies of desire (G.F. Watts, p. 88, 1904)."

      <sup><a href="#intext1" name="footnote1" id="footnote1">1</a></sup>
      Theoretically, there are an unlimited number of numeration systems. The
      most complete system (to be used by divine beings and angels) registers an
      infinite number of symbols, one for each number; the simplest only
      requires two. Zero is written <i>0</i>; one <i>1</i>, two, <i>10</i>,
      three <i>11</i>, four <i>100</i>, five <i>101</i>, six <i>110</i>, seven
      <i>111</i>, eight <i>1000</i>, etc. This was invented by Leibniz, who was
      (it seems) motivated by the secret hexagrams of the I Ching.

      <sup><a href="#intext2" name="footnote2" id="footnote1">2</a></sup> It's
      been pointed out a couple of times to me that, in Borges' original, the
      word translated as "whales" here is 'bellena' (whale), not 'belleza'
      (beauty), and so I correct it. Thanks to Justin Bur (who first pointed it
      out&mdash;in 2005!&mdash;and Douglas Crockford, who prompted me to make
      the change (Translator's note).
