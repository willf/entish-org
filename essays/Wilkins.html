  <p><b>The Analytical Language of John Wilkins</b></p>

  <p>Jorge Luis Borges, from <i>Otras Inquisiciones</i></p>

  <p><i>Translated by Will Fitzgerald</i></p>

  <p>I have checked, and the fourteenth edition of the
  Encyclopaedia Britannica has dropped its article on John Wilkins.
  This makes sense when you think of how trivial the article is&mdash;20
  lines of purely biographical facts: Wilkins was born in 1614,
  Wilkins died in 1672, Wilkins was chaplain for Charles Louise,
  Elector Palatine; Wilkins was named rector of one of the colleges
  at Oxford, Wilkins was the first Secretary of the Royal Society
  of London, etc. It is wrong, though, if we consider Wilkins's
  speculative work. He was abundantly curious: he was interested in
  theology, cryptography, music, the fabrication of transparent
  beehives, the orbit of an invisible planet, the possibility of
  traveling to the moon, the possibility of, and the principles
  underlying, a universal language. To this last problem he
  dedicated his book <i>Towards a Real Character and a
  Philosophical Language</i> (600 pages in quarto, 1668). Our
  National Library does not have a copy of this book; I have
  consulted, to write this note, <i>The Life and Times of John
  Wilkins</i> (1910), by P.A. Wright Henderson; the
  <i>W&ouml;rterbuch der Philosophie</i> (1924), by Fritz Mauthner;
  <i>Delphos</i> (1935) by E. Sylvia Pankhurst; and <i>Dangerous
  Thoughts</i> (1939), by Lancelot Hogben.</p>

  <p>Everyone, at some time, has had to endure one of those
  never-ending debates with someone, who, with copious
  interjections and locutions, insists that&mdash;say&mdash;the Spanish word
  "luna" is more (or less) expressive than the English word "moon."
  Apart from the obvious observation that the monosyllabic "moon"
  is perhaps more apt to represent such a simple object in contrast
  to the bisyllabic "luna," rhere is nothing one can add to these
  debates&mdash;discounting invented words and their derivations, all of
  the languages of the world (not excepting Johann Martin
  Schleyer's Volap&uuml;k and Peano's Interlingua) are equally
  inexpressive. There is no edition of the Royal Academy's
  <i>Gram&aacute;tica</i> that does not ponder "the enviable
  treasure of picturesque, felicitous and expressive voice of the
  rhythmic Spanish language," but this is mere swagger without
  support. Still, this self-same Royal Academy every few years
  produces a dictionary that define how Spanish sounds&mdash;In the
  universal language that Wilkins invented at the beginning of the
  17th century, every word contains its own definition. Descartes,
  in a letter dated November 1629, had already noted that, by means
  of a decimal numbering system, one could learn in a single day to
  name every quantity up to infinity and write them in a new
  language made up of figures<sup><a name="intext1" href=
  "#footnote1" id="intext1">1</a></sup>; he also proposed the
  creation of an analogous language which would be general,
  organizing and including every human thought. John Wilkins, about
  1664, undertook to complete this enterprise.</p>

  <p>He divided the universe into forty categories or genera,
  subdivided into differences, each subdivided into its own
  species. To every genus he assigned a monosyllable of two
  letters; for every difference, a consonant; for every species, a
  vowel. For example: <i>de</i>, that is, an element; <i>deb</i>,
  the first of the elements, fire; <i>deba</i> a part of the
  element of fire, a flame. In the analogical language of Letellier
  (1850), <i>a</i>, that is, animal; <i>ab</i>, mammal; <i>abo</i>,
  carnivore; <i>aboj</i>, feline; <i>aboje</i>, cat; <i>abi</i>,
  herbivore; <i>abiv</i>, equine, etc. In the language of Bonifacio
  Sotos Ochando (1845) <i>imaba</i> means building; <i>imaca</i>
  palace; <i>imafe</i>, hospital; <i>imafo</i>, lazaretto;
  <i>imela</i>, house; <i>imego</i>, a post; <i>imede</i>, a
  pillar; <i>imego,</i> floor; <i>imela</i>, ceiling; <i>imogo</i>,
  window; <i>bire</i>, a bookbinder; <i>birer</i>, bookbinding (I
  owe this final list to a book printed in Buenos Aires in 1886;
  <i>El Curso de lengua universal</i>, by Dr. Pedro Mata).</p>

  <p>The words in the Analytic Language of John Wilkins are not
  awkwardly created arbitrary symbols; every one of its letters is
  significant, just as the cabalists treat the letters in Holy
  Scripture. Mauthner observes that children could learn this
  language without knowing it is artificial; later, in school, they
  would discover that it is also a universal key and a secret
  encyclopaedia.</p>

  <p>I have defined Wilkins's method without examining a problem
  that is impossible or at least difficult to postpone: the value
  in the quadragesimal table that forms the basis of the language.
  Let us consider the eight category, that of <i>minerals</i>.
  Wilkins divides these into <i>common</i> (silica, gravel, slate),
  <i>useful</i> (marble, amber, coral), <i>precious</i> (pearls,
  opals), <i>transparent</i> (amethyst, sapphire) and
  <i>insoluble</i> (coal, chalk and arsenic). Almost as alarming as
  the eight category is the ninth. This describes metals that could
  be <i>imperfect</i> (cinnabar, quicksilver), <i>artificial</i>
  (bronze, brass), <i>recremental</i> (lime, rust) and
  <i>natural</i> (gold, tin, copper). <strike>Beauty</strike><sup><a name="intext2" href=
  "#footnote2" id="intext2">2</a></sup>The whale figures in category
  sixteen; it is a viviparous, oblong fish.</p>

  <p>These ambiguities, redundancies and deficiencies recall those
  that Dr. Franz Kuhn attributes to a certain Chinese dictionary
  entitled <i>The Celestial Emporium of Benevolent Knowledge</i>.
  In its remote pages it is written that animals can be divided
  into (a) those belonging to the Emperor, (b) those that are
  embalmed, (c) those that are tame, (d) pigs, (e) sirens, (f)
  imaginary animals, (g) wild dogs, (h) those included in this
  classification, (i) those that are crazy-acting (j), those that
  are uncountable (k) those painted with the finest brush made of
  camel hair, (l) miscellaneous, (m) those which have just broken a
  vase, and (n) those which, from a distance, look like flies. The
  Bibliographic Institute of Brussels practices this chaos: they
  have partitioned the universe into 1000 subdivisions, number 262
  corresponds to the Pope; #282, to the Catholic Religion; #263,
  the day of the Lord; #268, to the dominical schools; #298, to
  Mormonism; and #294 to Brahmanism, Buddhism, Shintoism and
  Taoism. It doesn't mind heterogeneous subdivisions, for example,
  #179: "Cruelty to animals. Prevention of cruelty to animals.
  Duels and suicide from the moral point of view. Vices and various
  defects. Virtues and various qualities."</p>

  <p>I have catalogued the arbitrarities of Wilkins, of the unknown
  (or apocryphal) Chinese encyclopaedia writer and of the
  Bibliographic Institute of Brussels; it is clear that there is no
  classification of the Universe that is not arbitrary and full of
  conjectures. The reason for this is very simple: we do not know
  what kind of thing the universe is. "The world," writes David
  Hume, "is perhaps the rudimentary sketch of a childish god, who
  left it half done, ashamed by his deficient work; it is created
  by a subordinate god, at whom the superior gods laugh; it is the
  confused production of a decrepit and retiring divinity, who has
  already died (<i>Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion</i>,
  1779)." But we can go further than that, to go on to suspect that
  there is no universe in a unified, organic sense, denoted by this
  ambitious word. If this is the case, it fails to support its
  intention; it fails to supply the words, the definitions, the
  etymologies, the synonyms out of the secret dictionary of
  God.</p>

  <p>The impossibility of penetrating the divine scheme of the
  universe does not, however, dissuade us from planning human
  schemes, even though we know they must be provisional. The
  Analytic Language of Wilkins is not the least admirable of these
  schemes. The genera and species that compose it are contradictory
  and vague; the artifice that the letters of the language indicate
  subdivisions and divisions is, without a doubt, ingenious. The
  word <i>salmon</i> tells us nothing, <i>zana</i>, its
  corresponding word, defines (for one well-versed in the forty
  categories and the genera of these categories) a scaled, fluvial
  fish of rose-colored flesh. (Theoretically, it is not
  inconceivable to have a language in which the name of each being
  indicates all of the details of its destiny, both past and
  future).</p>

  <p>Dreams and utopias apart, the most lucidly anyone has written
  about language are in these words by Chesterton: "He knows that
  there are in the soul tints more bewildering, more numberless,
  and more nameless than the colours of an autumn forest... Yet he
  seriously believes that these things can every one of them, in
  all their tones and semitones, in all their blends and unions, be
  accurately represented by an arbitrary system of grunts and
  squeals. He believes that an ordinary civilized stockbroker can
  really produce out of his own inside noises that denote all the
  mysteries of memory and all the agonies of desire (G.F. Watts, p.
  88, 1904)."</p>

  <p><sup><a href="#intext1" name="footnote1" id=
  "footnote1">1</a></sup> Theoretically, there are an unlimited
  number of numeration systems. The most complete system (to be
  used by divine beings and angels) registers an infinite number of
  symbols, one for each number; the simplest only requires two.
  Zero is written <i>0</i>; one <i>1</i>, two, <i>10</i>, three
  <i>11</i>, four <i>100</i>, five <i>101</i>, six <i>110</i>,
  seven <i>111</i>, eight <i>1000</i>, etc. This was invented by
  Leibniz, who was (it seems) motivated by the secret hexagrams of
  the I Ching.</p> 
  
  <p><sup><a href="#intext2" name="footnote2" id=
  "footnote1">2</a></sup> It's been pointed out a couple of times to me that, in Borges'
  original, the word translated as "whales" here is 'bellena' (whale), not 'belleza' (beauty),
  and so I correct it. Thanks to Justin Bur (who first pointed it out&mdash;in 2005!&mdash;and Douglas Crockford, who
  prompted me to make the change (Translator's note).</p>
