<p>.: On the face of it, this looks like just another boring PR piece: <a href="http://www.me-mag.com/bn.cfm?rank_cho=663">Cellport Systems Granted Serial Data Interface Control Document License from Qualcomm</a>. But here's what's interesting: It allows Cellport to control Qualcomm phones using Cellport's voice-based interface. Specifically:<blockquote>By gaining access to the QUALCOMM interface specification, Cellport will be able to begin producing Pocket Adapters for these handsets in the fourth quarter of this year. Cellport's unique Pocket Adapter system will allow users of CDMA phones to achieve hands-free, voice-activated operation in a safe and secure environment. Cellport already manufactures Pocket Adapters for handsets from Motorola and Nokia.</blockquote>

phone calls placed to an OnStar Call Center advisor from October 1996 (when
OnStar was introduced) through May 2000 was a driver known to be on the phone
at the time of a crash severe enough to deploy the vehicle's air bags.... In six other cases ... it was
determined that the driver was on the phone within 10 minutes before a crash
that deployed the air bags.  
</blockquote>

Only calls to OnStar and accidents resulting in an air bag deployment were studied.

<P>I've got to look into this more -- for example, how many air bag deployments were there, total? Meanwhile, GM has this <a href="http://gm.com/company/gmability/safety/senseable/driver_distraction/index.html">really cool driver distraction game</a> on the web.

<p>.: An important new <a href="http://www.nsc.org/library/shelf/inincell.htm">driver distraction study</a> from the National Saftety Council, comparing hand-held and hands-free cell phone use, as well as books-on-tape and listening to the radio. Conclusion:<blockquote>These data demonstrate that <b>the phone conversation itself</b> resulted in significant slowing in the response to simulated traffic signals, as well as an increase in the likelihood of missing these signals. Moreover, the fact that <b>hand-held and hands-free cell phones resulted in equivalent ... deficits</b> indicates that the interference was not due to peripheral factors such as holding the phone while conversing. <b>These findings also rule out interpretations that attribute the deficits ... to simply attending to verbal material</b>, because dual-task deficits were not observed in the book-on-tape control. Active engagement in the cell phone conversation appears to be necessary to produce the observed dual-task interference.</blockquote>(Emphasis mine). <a href="http://www.nsc.org/news/nr081501a.htm">NSC press release</a>. <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2001/US/08/16/cell.phone.driving/index.html" title="thanks, mrh!">CNN new report</a>.

That compares with 120.1 million users currently in the United States.</blockquote> And there's room to grow: only 1 in 10 Chinese has a cell phone, compared to 4 in 10 for US citizens:<blockquote>In July alone, China added 3.8 million cell-phone subscribers.</blockquote>

<p>.: Research on multitasking: <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2001/CAREER/trends/08/05/multitasking.focus/index.html">CNN reportage</a>:<blockquote>Driving while talking on a cell phone, maybe making business calls while trying to get to your next meeting, is being used by these researchers as an example of a potentially disastrous multitasking scenario. 

"A lot of folks," says [report co-author David] Meyer, "think, 'Well, cell phoning while driving is really no big deal and I can get away with it.' But even if you have a cell phone that's not held by hand and can be dialed by voice, you still have a really big conflict because when you're driving you need to be looking at various different places, you need to be reading signs, you need to be talking to yourself about those in order to -- through your mental speech -- make decisions about where to go with your car. And there's no way to do that while on the cell phone because you have to use your 'inner ears' and 'inner speech' and even your 'inner eyes' to imagine what the person on the phone is talking about."

<p>.: Motorola is providing telematics to Audi (<a href="http://news.excite.com/news/pr/010731/il-motorola-audi-ag">press release</a>):<blockquote>Designed and fine-tuned for Audi cars, the Motorola Telematics Communications Unit (TCU), serves as the wireless gateway for the Audi infotainment system. The TCU allows drivers to access the special telematics services through an Audi portal and the Internet directly. The joint development of the Audi infotainment system also includes the use of Motorola communications solutions with enhanced functionality based on Java(TM) and MOST (Media Oriented System Transport).

In addition to the benefits of an embedded hands-free phone, the TCU also provides telematics and Internet services, based on GSM dual-band and General Packet Radio Services (GPRS) technologies. The integrated wireless modem in the TCU can be converted for later use as a UMTS-enabled variant. A Bluetooth(TM) wireless interface also allows for data exchange between the TCU and other Bluetooth wireless capable devices, such as Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs) and notebook computers.
