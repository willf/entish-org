<p><a href="http://www.commweb.com/article/COM20010425S0003" title="From ITS">Telematics: The Real Wireless Frontier</a> (General Article). Good quote on interface:<blockquote>Take the user interface issue. Already we are moving rapidly to a voice-dialing and hands-free environment in automotive wireless. Speech recognition will become the predominant mode of interaction between a driver and a wireless service or application. And rather than use an IVR-like interface (with a series of numbered prompts and branching-tree options), telematic services are going to migrate rather quickly (I predict) to become more "barge-in"-based and truly interactive. They will also become more location sensitive, with applications tying into the car's GPS systems to provide a truly context-aware interaction.</blockquote>

<p>Another reason, perhaps, to be skeptical about satellite radio: apparently, Sirius and XM are <a href="http://www.me-mag.com/topstry.cfm">not doing a good job of training retailers</a>.

<p>Is satellite radio more like cable or more like broadcast radio? Peoplea are willing to pay for cable, but it's difficult to get people to pay for broadcast radio (listen to any public radio station during pledge week). <a href="http://www.mitechnews.com/show_article.asp?category=38&id=725">This week's AutoTech Talk column</a> by Paul Eisenstein discusses commercial-free satellite-to-car radio. My guess is that this will fail. Reasons: there are other options for "commercial-free" listening (CDs, tapes, books on tape, public radio); most commericials are better than  popular music (ok, I'm revealing my bias here); you have to buy a special receiver <i>before</i> you know what you'll be getting, and you already <i>have</i> a regular radio. A lot will depend on the quality and consistency of the signal, I think, as well as their marketing campaigns. Eisenstein says XM Satellite Radio "expects to have 100,000 customers signed on by the end of December." This seems <i>very</i> unlikely to me.

<p><b>Note: the argument below, I've been shown, is faulty</b> even if Lamport's fomula is correct (for which I have no proof). Buridan's Principle only takes into account <i>the decision time</i>, not the whole of the reaction time.  Unless I could show a (continous) effect on decision time, Buridan's Principle doesn't apply. <i>Why don't they teach logic at these schools? --CS Lewis</i>

<p><table border=1 cellpadding=4><tr><td>
<p>I've been thinking about the implications of <a href="http://research.compaq.com/SRC/personal/lamport/pubs/pubs.html#buridan">Buridan's Principle</a>, formulated by Leslie Lamport, for driver safety and driver distraction. The principle is:<blockquote>A discrete decision based upon an input having a continous range of values cannot be made within a bounded length of time.</blockquote>

<p>In a note, <a href="http://catless.ncl.ac.uk/Risks/10.44.html#subj1.1">Lamport claims</a> that one can estimate the probability of a failure to make a binary decision, given a time to make the decision, and the average reaction time. The formula he gives is <b>e^(-T/R)</b>, where T is time to make the decision, and R is reaction time.

<p>We can use this formula to estimate how quick a reaction time one needs in order to make a decision with a given time at a given probability. This formula is <b>R=-T/ln P</b>, with P being the probability. 

<p>According to <a href="http://www.gov.nb.ca/dot/mv/handbook/part5/driver.shtml">this Canada Department of Transportation</a> article, average reaction time to move from the gas pedal to the brakes is .75 seconds. 

<p>Using these numbers, I created this spreadsheet [<i>removed--see above</i>]. It indicates, for example, that under normal human reaction times, there will be a "bad decision" (perhaps resulting in an accident) around 1 in a 1000 times if a driver has 5 seconds to respond. Increase this just to 1 second, and it will be 1 in a 100.

<p>Is this right? <a href="mailto:fitzgerald@inetmi.com">Let me know</a>.

GM would be shortsighted to depend on telematics services for its survival, let alone a primary means of growth. That's not to say OnStar or GM's other Internet commerce initiatives won't add to the top or bottom lines. Or even generate nice profit margins, possibly as high as 25 to 30 percent. But recurring revenue streams and incremental additions to overall net income will do little to change how GM is perceived in the hearts and minds of those on Wall Street.</blockquote>

<p>CommWeb did a useful <a href="http://www.commweb.com/article/COM20010129S0003" title="thanks, Jim Firby">review of VoiceXML portals</a>. One can imagine using VoiceXML to build an information service accessible via cell phone. <blockquote>"CT Labs used the VoiceXML Forum's spec, and reports that the test engineer found the concept and structure of the language fairly easy to use. They note that although they mapped out what they considered a simple six-page script, it took their engineer a week to learn and code the app to VoiceXML standards. Therefore, for someone creating a real-world app, with a live database behind it and more complex functions, the amount of time would be greater." </blockquote><P>A week doesn't seem that long to me. One problem the testers ran into was that the various vendors required different scripts, despite all of them use the VoiceXML "standard."

<b>Why doesn't my Palm V/Vx screen stay active when I use it with the MPCpro?</b>-- It would be tempting to glance down at an active screen. Keeping the Palm V/Vx screen inactive helps you keep your eyes on the road and your hands on the wheel - it also reduces the Palm's power consumption. <br><b>Can anyone in the vehicle use the MPCpro?</b>-- The MPCpro is designed to be used by the driver. Never let a passenger sit directly in front of the device, as it could cause severe injury in the event of an accident. Always install the MPCpro according to the instructions in the owner's manual. 
</blockquote>

<p>On the other hand:<blockquote><b>Can I use a headset with MPCpro instead of using the sound system?</b>-- Yes, but make sure it's legal to do so where you drive. A few states have made it unlawful to use headsets while driving. (The MPCpro broadcasts its text-to-speech to the car's radio.)</blockquote><p>Further, there's nothing about the potential dangers of listening to email or talking on the cell phone while driving.

<p>More on companies that create noise cancellation technology for in-vehicle microphones.

<p>Clarity is a company located in Troy, Michigan. According to <a href="http://www.clarityco.com">their website</a>:<blockquote>Clarity develops proprietary software products for the rapidly expanding Voice Interface industry, enabling effective voice commands and communications in noisy environments. Voice activated instructions represent the ultimate user-friendly man-machine interface. Clarity's patent pending "Clear Voice Capture™" ("CVC™") technology "humanizes" the way people communicate with computers and other electronic devices. With this enabling voice technology, a number of functions (currently performed by typing on a keyboard or pushing touch type controls) in the office, car, industrial and home environments can be done via voice commands. Clarity's CVC technology improves the quality of the voice signal to enable the performance of speech recognition software and enhance transmission functions. Additionally, by reducing the levels of digitized noise over telecommunications systems, bandwidth is optimized. </blockquote>

<P><a href="http://www.localbusiness.com">LocalBusiness.com</a> has written a couple of articles about Clarity, including <a href="http://www.localbusiness.com/Story/0,1118,DTT_520878,00.html">this backgrounder</a> about the company:<blockquote>Clarity's technology was originally designed by Fathi Salam and Gail Erten of Okemos, Mich., in 1993, as a commercial spinoff of software used by the U.S. Air Force. At that time, Erten obtained a $1.3 million Small Business and Research (SBIR) Grant from the U.S. Dept. of Defense to package the technology for commercial use.  Clarity was founded in 1998 to commercialize the technology. It received $1.95 million in two rounds of funding from angel investors and $2.5 million in its first round of venture capital in June.</blockquote>

<p>Here's an interesting study on driver distraction: <a href="http://www.apa.org/journals/xap/xap6131.html">Effects of Verbal and Spatial—Imagery Tasks on Eye Fixations While Driving</a>. It's fairly technical, but it compares how a simple verbal task (coming up with words that start with a certain letter) and a simple spatial imagery task (imagining the rotation of letters and whether the letters are 'closed' (like '6') or 'open' (like '3') and how 'no task' effect several measurements of driver distraction on real roads. <p>My general take-away: in general, spatial imaging is more distracting than a verbal task, which is more distracting than driving alone. 
<p>An interesting anomaly in <a href="http://www.apa.org/journals/xap/S_xap6131fig8a.jpg" target="_new">this chart</a>, which shows how often drivers looked at the interior mirror, left-hand mirror and speedometer by task type. In some cases, the verbal task correlated with more looks at the left-hand mirror than no task. It also seems to show that drivers <i>choose</i> what to pay attention to under different conditions: note that no or little attention to the speedometer unless the drivers are engaged in no other task; similarly with attention to the interior mirror (although this differs by road type).
<p>Does this mean that a conversational interface would be less distracting than interacting with visual displays beside the steering wheel? The answer is complex, and this study indicates that there are many variables to consider, but I think it lends some weight to the argument, especially if the interface responds differently under different driving conditions (i.e., it might not engage in dialog if the driver is decelerating rapidly, for example).
